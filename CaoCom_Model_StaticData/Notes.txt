opname: Should be broken into different parts: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_surgical_procedures  <- Next Step? ;)
opname always as prefix and suffix -> Split opname into prefix and suffix to enhance detailed classificaiton
-> Does not work opname does not follow basic structure: Occurence Table shows, most of the opname occur several times. Just use grouping as with gender.
-> Observation Step: We might should not includes opnames with a low co-Occurence! Some have value 1 only.
-> Results get much worse: Best result with Random Forest at 3,09 MSE
